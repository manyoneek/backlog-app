# Add2Wallet — Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 23, 2026*

## Overview

Add2Wallet converts PDF documents into Apple Wallet passes. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how we handle your data.

## Data We Process

**PDF files you upload** are sent to our server solely for the purpose of generating an Apple Wallet pass. PDFs are processed in memory and any temporary files are automatically deleted immediately after the pass is generated and delivered to your device. We do not store, retain, or share your PDF files.

## Data We Collect

**Purchase history:** If you make in-app purchases, transaction data is processed by Apple and RevenueCat (our payment infrastructure provider). RevenueCat receives an anonymous app user ID — we do not provide your name, email, or any personal identifiers. For details, see [RevenueCat's Privacy Policy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy/).

**No accounts required:** Add2Wallet does not require you to create an account, sign in, or provide any personal information.

**No analytics or tracking:** We do not use analytics SDKs, advertising identifiers, or any form of user tracking.

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Names, email addresses, or contact information
- Location data
- Device identifiers (beyond what Apple provides for purchases)
- Usage analytics or behavioral data
- Contents of your PDF files (not stored after processing)

## Third-Party Services

- **Apple (App Store, Apple Wallet)** — handles purchases and pass storage on your device
- **RevenueCat** — processes in-app purchase transactions with anonymous user IDs
- **OpenAI** — PDF text is sent to OpenAI's API for metadata extraction (event name, date, venue, etc.). No personally identifiable information is intentionally sent. See [OpenAI's Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy).

## Data Retention

Uploaded PDFs and generated passes are deleted from our server immediately after delivery. We retain no user data on our servers.

## Children's Privacy

Add2Wallet does not knowingly collect data from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.
