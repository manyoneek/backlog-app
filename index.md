# Privacy Policy

**Backlog — Track Games**  
*Last updated: February 21, 2026*

## Overview

Backlog — Track Games ("the App") is designed with your privacy in mind. We believe your data is yours and yours alone.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal data.**

The App does not:
- Create user accounts
- Require sign-in or registration
- Track your location
- Collect analytics or usage data
- Use advertising SDKs
- Share any information with third parties

## Data Storage

All your game library data is stored **locally on your device** using Apple's SwiftData framework. Your data never leaves your device.

If you delete the App, all locally stored data will be permanently removed.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the [RAWG Video Games Database API](https://rawg.io/) to search for and display game information (titles, descriptions, ratings, screenshots, and platform availability). These requests are made directly from your device to RAWG's servers. We do not proxy, log, or store any of these requests.

Please refer to [RAWG's Privacy Policy](https://rawg.io/privacy-policy) for information about how they handle API requests.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.
